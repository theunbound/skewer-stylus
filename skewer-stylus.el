;;; skewer-stylus.el --- Skewer support for live interaction with stylus -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

;; Author: Kristoffer Levin Hansen <kristoffer@levinhansen.dk>
;; Keywords: languages, tools
;; Version: 1.0.0
;; URL: https://github.com/theunbound/skewer-stylus
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "27.1") (skewer-mode "1.8.0"))

;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode provides functionality for Stylus like plain skewer
;; does for JavaScript, or skewer-less for Less.

;; * C-x C-e -- ‘skewer-stylus-send-declaration’
;; * C-M-x   -- ‘skewer-stylus-send-rule’
;; * C-x C-k -- ‘skewer-stylus-eval-block’

;; Customization variables ‘skewer-stylus-block-start-regexp’ and
;; ‘skewer-stylus-block-end-regexp’ contain lists of rexexps that
;; identify the opening respective closing of a stylus block. By
;; default, they contain expressions that match opening respective
;; closing html style tags.

;; There is no support for Stylus funcitons or mixins. If you who are
;; reading the comments in the source files want to contribute code to
;; add that support, it would certainly be appreciated.

;; As the Stylus documentation says, “What if everything was
;; optional?” It makes parsing more difficult, is what. We try our
;; best to deal with the various ways that Stylus has of deliniating
;; rules, but the primary focus has been to support the style that has
;; neither semicolons nor curly-braces. The more complicated the
;; coding style of what you feed skewer-stylus, the more likely it is
;; to become confused. As always, there are no guarantees.

;; As the license file points out...
